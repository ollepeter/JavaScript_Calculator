# JavaScript_Calculator
CodeCool Assignment - JavaScript Calculator

This project is to create a calculator running in the browser, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

It should have buttons for the digits, and for the operators (+, -, /, *, %), a dot to be able to work with floating numbers, an equal sign (=) to get the result, and a C button to reset the calculators state. 

It should also have a display showing the current input, and the result.

Content:
- an HTML file which shows the buttons and the display input
- a CSS file (used by the HTML) which makes the calculator a little bit nicer
- a JavaScript file which implements the behavior of the calculator
